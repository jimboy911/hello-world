# hello-world
#Creating my first repository

#This commit is to show I can follow directions on the GitHub guides by describing a little about myself.
#I'm currently a bginner learning about Python and programming, in general.
#As my practice projects get more and more complex, I started realizing the need to keep track of my changes
#in case I screw up a change and need to roll back, but I forgot what my code looked like before
